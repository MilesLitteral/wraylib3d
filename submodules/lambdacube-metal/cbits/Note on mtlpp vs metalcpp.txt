metal-cpp is an, in theory, more complete version of mtlpp maintained by Apple themselves.
If mtlpp proves too troublesome/problematic (it is not totally Metal 3 compliant and would need tweaks)
then make mtlpp.h and .cc an interface to utilize metal-cpp instead. 

implement the use of metal-cpp instead from now on (3/15/24). The interface shall be called mtlpp.h in honor
of the original interface written.
