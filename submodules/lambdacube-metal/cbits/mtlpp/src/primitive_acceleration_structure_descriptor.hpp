class MTLPrimitiveAccelerationStructureDescriptor : MTLAccelerationStructureDescriptor
Overview
Metal provides acceleration structures with a two-level hierarchy. The bottom layer consists of primitive acceleration structures, which instance acceleration structures in the top level reference.

Topics
Specifying Geometry
var geometryDescriptors: [MTLAccelerationStructureGeometryDescriptor]?
An array that contains the individual pieces of geometry that compose the acceleration structure.
Specifying Motion Behavior
var motionKeyframeCount: Int
The number of keyframes in the geometry data.
var motionStartTime: Float
The start time for the range of motion that the keyframe data describes.
var motionEndTime: Float
The end time for the range of motion that the keyframe data describes.
var motionStartBorderMode: MTLMotionBorderMode
The mode to use when handling timestamps before the start time.
var motionEndBorderMode: MTLMotionBorderMode
The mode to use when handling timestamps after the end time.
enum MTLMotionBorderMode
Options for specifying how the acceleration structure handles timestamps that are outside the specified range.
