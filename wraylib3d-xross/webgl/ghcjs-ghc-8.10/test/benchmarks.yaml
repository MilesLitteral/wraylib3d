# this file describes the test group locations with their name
# 
# every group (directory) is scanned for Haskell (.hs or .lhs)
# files that start with a lower case letter (Uppercase means
# that it's a module used by some test).
#
# every test has its own settings file (testname.settings)
# and expected output and exit code (testname.out, testname.err, testname.exit)
#
# if none of the .out, .err and .exit files are present, the
# test case is run against 'runhaskell', expecting the same result
