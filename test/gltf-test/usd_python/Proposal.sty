SOO Content for ATAT Follow On1 Background: On September 13, 2017, the Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan established a new initiative to accelerate adoption 
of cloud computing technologies through the acquisition of a modern enterprise cloud services solution.
2 Consistent with the 2018 DoD Cloud Strategy, 
the DoD CIO intends for the Account Tracking and Automation Tool (ATAT) to be capable of supporting differing DoD enterprise cloud environments. 
The ATAT capability will enable rapid access and adoption of enterprise cloud services by implementing a self-service, automated provisioning tool 
offering common configurations and standards to take full advantage of cloud services acquired by the Department with built-in controls and oversight 
for security, billing, and ease of use. The Government will receive an initial Minimally Viable Product (MVP) for ATAT in September 2020 specific to 
the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Cloud. The resultant contract associated with this Statement of Objectives will support the development 
of enhanced capabilities and sustainment of ATAT code baseline for JEDI Cloud as well as other cloud environments, as necessary, to support DoD’s enterprise
 loud provisioning needs. ATAT Team: Key operating teams for ATAT include: CCPO: The Cloud Computing Program Office (CCPO) is the program office managing development 
 and deployment of ATAT development for customers, and serves as the product owner of the ATAT capability. The CCPO team will provide oversight and guidance for design, 
 technical development, and business process requirements. The CCPO is also the primary liaison between the 1 This Statement of Objectives document also includes two appendices 
 that describe the Government’s approach to sprint management for this contract. 2 The ATAT provisioning tool was initially focused on the 
 Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Cloud program and, as a natural byproduct, 
 the current ATAT open source software code base has embedded references to JEDI Cloud or other derivative names.

        ○ Application of security configurations 
        ■ Initiate cloud services 
        ■ Modify security settings of cloud services 
        ○ Enable access to the CSP portal 
        ○ Programmatic access to security and audit logs Enterprise System Interoperations The system interfaces are capable of the following, at minimum: 
            ● Connection to specified DoD identity systems 
            ● Connection to specified financial systems 
            ● Connection to the CSP APIs 
            ● Programmatic access and individual user access via: 
                ○ Common Access Card (CAC)/Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authentication 
                ○ Multi-factor authentication 
            ● Central management of: 
                ○ Accounts 
                ○ Users 
                ○ Billing 
                ○ Security policies 
                ○ Security and audit logs

                ○ Evaluate and enforce policy enforcement 
                ○ Approve process and implementation for policy deviations General Capability Development and Delivery The system will be developed to minimize the required user training (intuitive look, feel, and operation). 
                  Any necessary training will be provided for each delivery. The CI/CD pipeline will solicit continuous user input and feedback for all pipeline resident items. The delivery 
                  methodology will include opportunities for inspection of designs by the CCPO and feedback mechanisms of functional users for pre-deployment prototypes. The system must 
                  demonstrate the ability to natively reside in a cloud environment, to include a commercial cloud (fully managed or hybrid) or a private cloud (hybrid or exclusively 
                  managed by the Government), and use all native cloud features, including, but not limited to: 
                    ● Resources provisioned on demand 
                    ● Resources scale based on real-time user demand 
                    ● Resources provisioned through an API 
                    ● Resources available in multiple regions 
                    ● Applications hosted on commodity hardware 
                    ● Cloud based Database services (Kubernetes, etc) 
                    ● Restrict charges to Government resources used Multi-Domain Operations Objective: Page 8 HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment J-1 6 July 2020 
                    The development of all delivered items should use an unclassified CI/CD pipeline. Each of the delivered items, and all “assembled”
                     items (integrated or interoperated), must support enhancements, or be natively qualified, to operate in a SECRET and Top Secret domain. 
                     This will ensure that the ATAT look and feel is uniform for all operating domains and the end users will not need any additional training for unique domains. 
                     The data that ATAT generates, from within each domain, should be consumable by any instance of ATAT in its respective domain. While it is unlikely that higher 
                     classified data will be demoted to a lower level classification, it is not improbable that lower level data may be copied to a higher level classification 
                     domain for comprehensive reporting. Data Management Objectives: The system will support full data management processes, 
                     including but not limited to: 
                     ● Data system design and management 
                     ● Data utilization profiles 
                     ● Data access optimization 
                     ● Data creation, destruction, and sustainment

                     ● Data securitization (at-rest, in-transit [internal and external]) 
                     ● Data sharing, internal and external, with appropriate control mechanisms 
                     ● Support for data policy creation

                        ● Ability to integrate testing practices directly into the CI/CD pipeline or execute independently 
                        ● Ability to collect a large number and significantly data-dense logs that may not normally be collected (verbose logging) of testing environments; especially
                         when replicating and testing issues, breaches, or other non-desired events and behaviors occur User Experience (UX) Objectives: Incorporating modern UX 
                         design into ATAT is a critical ATAT requirement to support ease of use, intuitive experience, and speed for customers. 
                         Design encompasses ongoing user research and feedback, usability evaluation, user interface design, interaction design, 
                         visual design, content strategy, and similar elements to the user experience. The system interface should minimally be web-enabled. 
                         The user experience should support: 
                            ● A limited connectivity modality (modem or phone data traffic rates) 
                            ● Intuitive presentation and information flow (limited need for training) 
                            ● Actuated in-line self-help information (e.g. mouse over bubble for context blurbs)
                            ● Compliance with Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 USC § 794d) (e.g. vision impairment assistance) 
                            ● Capture and storage (in a consumable and reusable repository with unrestricted Government access) of all information 
                              for goals, needs, behaviors, and preferences collected from the functional user community 
                            ● All UX requirements artifacts are identified to the requirements elicitation event from which they were derived 
                            ● All user engagement platforms ([e.g.: phones, tablets, laptops, desktops, G-terminals)], and for each mobile platform 
                              it shall be “mobile friendly” (i.e. dynamic rendering based on the size and presentation capabilities of the device). 
                        Training Objectives: The system is delivered with complete documentation to support future efforts, testing, training, security analysis and enhancement, 
                        deployment, system administration, operations, sustainment, and end user training. The training approach should focus on self-motivated or 
                        self-managed sessions for self- enrichment within the tool itself. The medium for training is not constrained to documentation, but any multimedia 
                        presentation methods must be fully consumable under the User Interface Experience (UIX) considerations.

                                  Page 12 HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment J-1 6 July 2020 Appendix A: Planning Milestones and Sprints The Government establishes the objectives for each 
                                  milestone period. There are four milestones per annum. This provides a clear and consistent basis for the scope of every milestone period and allows 
                                  the vendor to identify the sprints needed to achieve the milestone’s objectives. When the Government establishes each milestone and its objectives
                                   the vendor plans each sprint and its capability to achieve the appropriate objective outcome. A sprint provides a measurable enhancement to all 
                                   prior sprint deliverables that is a direct benefit to achieving a successful objective outcome. The vendor and the Government reviews the proposed 
                                   sprints for inclusion in the formal sprint backlog. Ultimately, the Government approves or rejects each sprint for inclusion in the formal sprint
                                    backlog. The Government is able to influence capability delivery by approving each sprint. The vendor is able to identify where a sprint belongs 
                                    (which milestone period and the specific objective) and optimize resources to achieve best outcomes and capability delivery. This approach bounds 
                                    the risk of the vendor from the unknown future requirements using the defined milestone objective scope. The Government and vendor collaboratively
                                     identify the acceptable functional capability for every sprint and the ability to achieve the objective outcome. This frees the Government from 
                                     needing to pre-specify every requirement in a contrived schedule, enabling the Government and the vendor to shift requirements and capabilities 
                                     as needs arise and demands change. During the sprint planning session there will be additional capability deliveries that are approved by the 
                                     Government, as necessary, but which will be beyond the scope of the current milestone under consideration. These additional capability deliveries
                                      are immediately added to the milestone planning as future objectives and will result in a formal sprint backlog addition, including the 
                                      objective and milestone to which it will belong. The formal sprint backlog is the tool by which the Government and the vendor use to manage 
                                      which milestone a sprint belongs. Any other capabilities that have not been rejected by the Government, not included in a sprint, and are not 
                                      part of the formal sprint backlog, are moved to a proposed vendor sprint backlog for future consideration by the Government. This allows the 
                                      vendor to identify capabilities they consider valuable and present these items to the Government for future consideration. The proposed vendor 
                                      sprint backlog is not part of the formal sprint backlog, and, therefore, no item in the proposed vendor sprint backlog may be included in the 
                                      delivered capabilities required for meeting any milestone objective or for inclusion or consideration as part of an incentive fee. A rejected 
                                      capabilities log shall be maintained to prevent rework or revisiting items that the Government has rejected. Page 13 HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment
                                    J-1 6 July 2020 Appendix B: Accelerating Capability Delivery This Appendix contains a discussion of the CCPO intent to manage milestones, 
                                    objectives and sprints as well as the opportunity for incentives to accelerate work. Concept Discussion The ATAT system is intended to be a 
                                    front-end provisioning tool to one or more DoD enterprise cloud suites. To this end, the Department has invested in the initial minimally viable 
                                    product (MVP) to support the General Purpose Cloud (GPC) offering. The current ATAT MVP meets the Government’s basic initial requirements; 
                                    however, the Government intends to continue to add functionality to the product based on user feedback and changing mission requirements. 
                                    The CCPO will acquire additional software development services to continue development of the ATAT MVP to achieve full functional capability. 
                                    The work will be managed using agile software development methodologies to allow continuous integration and continuous delivery/deployment (CI/CD). 
                                    
                                    This approach enables the DoD to obtain an extremely flexible development environment that is responsive to the evolving requirements of the functional and operational 
                                    communities using GPC or other cloud services. To achieve optimal value out of the CI/CD pipeline process and align with agile development patterns, we are establishing 
                                    a contracting approach that enables the Government to maintain commercial software development integration and deployment outcomes typically achieved with modern commercial 
                                    software practices. The approach has a base element and an incentive option that provides the Government with excellent risk management and performance assessment, enabling 
                                    flexibility to accelerate capability delivery. The approach also maintains the necessary minimum capability deployments for cloud services access and strategic roadmap alignment.
                                     Base Element: The base element is a Firm-Fixed-Price Level of Effort construct that provides a fixed period of work with established milestones for delivery of capability to 
                                     achieve one or more of the mission objectives. Within the period of work, the developer will collaborate with the Government to establish sprints that are both reasonable 
                                     amounts of work and provide ever increasing incremental capability to ultimately meet the milestones objectives for each period. The contract is divided into milestone periods. 
                                     Each milestone period will be a length of three months, so that there are four milestone periods per contract term (4 in the base year and 4 in each option year). The level of 
                                     effort for each milestone period has a ceiling price for the vendor team and associated resources. This model allows the Government to manage the sprint delivery to achieve the
                                      capabilities that address the specified objectives. This also affords the vendor the latitude to organize each sprint using an optimized team while managing the overall 
                                      approach to milestone delivery (there are multiple sprints per milestone and the objectives). Together, this provides true flexibility for the vendor to organize the work in an 
                                      optimal fashion, while enabling the Government to mitigate risk. The first milestone period (milestone 0) is used to assist the Government’s understanding of vendor ability to 
                                      achieve positive work outcomes. Milestone 0 also provides the necessary learning window for the vendor and the Government to collaborate and solidify a meaningful and 
                                      productive partnership. A Page 14 HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment J-1 6 July 2020 key outcome for Milestone 0 is the ability for the vendor to size sprints properly and demonstrate 
                                      to the Government their ability to deliver capabilities that, when all sprints are completed for the period, achieve the full set of milestone objectives.
                                      
                                      Proposed Incentive Structure: The Government will use an incentive fee to entice the vendor to add capability to each milestone period to enhance the ATAT product. 
                                      The added capability is an additional milestone objective shifted forward from a future planned milestone period. The incentive fee and the associated incentive milestone 
                                      objectives will be established at the beginning of each incentive period (e.g. every six months). Each of these initial sprint backlog approval sessions, for a single 
                                      milestone, is used to establish the number of additional capabilities (shifted milestone objectives) that are moved forward on the schedule. 
                                      
                                      Each objective that is shifted forward qualifies for an incentive fee, which is calculated as a percentage of the period of performance (recommended fixed constant); each 
                                      accelerated objective is a fixed percentage constant of the total annual cost for the period of performance and the total available incentive is 10% 
                                      of the value of CLIN XX01 and CLIN XX02. The incentive fee shall only be granted if all of the milestone objectives are accepted for delivery by the Government. 
                                      The value of each incentive objective and the number of incentive objectives available will be documented in the incentive plan approved by the Government. 
                                      How this works: The milestone 0 has no future events defined, and therefore no incentives are available for this specific milestone. 
                                      This is the period that the collaborative relationship is formed and the initial milestone delivery is executed using sprints to achieve the prescribed objectives. 
                                      Once the milestone 0 work commences, and the Government ascertains the contractor’s performance abilities, future milestone planning can begin. 
                                      During the milestone planning session, the Government will identify the list of objectives required for the next milestone(s).
                                      
                                      Once a future milestone is established (beyond Milestone 1), the contractor is able to accelerate an objective delivery into the current milestone period 
                                      (e.g. Milestone 2-Objective 3 shifts to Milestone 1). For any incentive to be possible, at least one milestone plan must exist beyond the current milestone, 
                                      further encouraging the contractor to support the Government in the planning process. A milestone, as originally scoped, must be fully delivered and accepted 
                                      by the Government to receive an incentive (i.e. incentives are only awarded if all of the objectives in the current milestone period are complete and at least 
                                      one additional objective from a future milestone period is achieved). If the milestone is complete and delivered with additional objectives, the incentive fee is awarded. 
                                      
                                      Rationale: The base price of a milestone (constant price), and its scope, is pre-established prior to any discussion of an additional capability for the incentive fee. 
                                      The vendor will be able to better plan for software development efficiencies by constantly monitoring the sprint backlog and future milestone objectives for opportunities 
                                      to benefit from supplemental resource additions and natural pairing of capabilities for development. Benefit: The vendor has the opportunity to increase revenue capture 
                                      during the annual period of performance, while the Government incentivises exceptional performance and receives additional capability earlier than planned. The Government 
                                      and the vendor also benefit from schedule Page 15 HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment J-1 6 July 2020 compression. This potentially allows the Government to obtain more capabilities 
                                      within the period of performance, and allows for a better product delivered to the Government.
