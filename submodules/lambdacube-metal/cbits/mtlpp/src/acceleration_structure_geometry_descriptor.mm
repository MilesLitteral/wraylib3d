Declaration
class MTLAccelerationStructureGeometryDescriptor : NSObject
Overview
Donâ€™t use this base class directly. Use one of the derived classes instead, as MTLAccelerationStructure describes.

Topics
Specifying Base Geometry Properties
var label: String?
A label for the geometry structure, suitable for debugging.
var intersectionFunctionTableOffset: Int
An index into the intersection table for determining which intersection function Metal calls when it intersects a ray with the acceleration structure.
var opaque: Bool
A Boolean value that determines whether the geometry data in the acceleration structure needs to skip triangle-intersection tests.
var allowDuplicateIntersectionFunctionInvocation: Bool
A Boolean value that indicates whether Metal calls the ray-intersection test more than once per primitive on the structure.
Instance Properties
