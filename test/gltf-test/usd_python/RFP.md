Request for Proposal (RFP)

## Introduction
This Request for Proposal (RFP) is issued by Bridgephase for the purpose of providing contract-based IT services for qualified vendors. The objective of this RFP is to submit a proposal to supply the Department of Defense (DoD) such services.

## Background
Bridgephase, established in [Year], is a leading contract firm in Information Technology(IT). The DoD CIO intends for the Account Tracking and Automation Tool (ATAT) to be capable of supporting differing DoD enterprise cloud environments. The ATAT capability will enable rapid access and adoption of enterprise cloud services by implementing a self-service, automated provisioning tool offering common configurations and standards to take full advantage of cloud services acquired by the Department with built-in controls and oversight for security, billing, and ease of use. The Government will receive an initial Minimally Viable Product (MVP) for ATAT in September 2020 specific to the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) Cloud. 

The resultant contract associated with this Statement of Objectives will support the development of enhanced capabilities and sustainment of ATAT code baseline for JEDI Cloud as well as other cloud environments, as necessary, to support DoD’s enterprise cloud provisioning needs. ATAT Team: Key operating teams for ATAT include: CCPO: The Cloud Computing Program Office (CCPO) is the program office managing development and deployment of ATAT development for customers, and serves as the product owner of the ATAT capability. The CCPO team will provide oversight and guidance for design, technical development, and business process requirements. 

Therefore, DoD is seeking a vendor that can help undertake the creation or acquisition of Account Tracking and Automation Tool (ATAT) as required to support our ongoing operations and strategic objectives. On September 13, 2017, the Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan established a new initiative to accelerate adoption of cloud computing technologies through the acquisition of a consistent modern enterprise cloud services solution. 

## Scope Of Work
If selected, we will be responsible for the following:
* Deliverable 1: Design, Build, Integrate, Enhance, and Sustain the ATAT.
* Deliverable 2: Leading, Planning, and executing the ATAT product and collaborating with the Government to deploy and maintain the ATAT capability in the Government identified Cloud Service Providers (CSP).
* Additional Responsibilities:  Facilitating project access to DoD personnel, advising on policies and regulations, and clearing blockers.

## Requirements
Proposals should address the following requirements:

### Technical Specifications:  
* The entire set of capabilities that exists in the code baseline at contract award must be delivered in an operable state within 30 days from contract award. A complete design for all existing capabilities in the newly proposed deliverable must be delivered to CCPO within 30 days from contract award. A full demonstration that clearly identifies each of the code baseline capabilities are present and operable and have been fully incorporated and integrated into the Contractor code baseline replacement.

* The entire code baseline replacement shall be completed using a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline, that the Government accepts as sufficient, and have delivery items (a discrete, independent, and operable software delivery) to demonstrate continual progress to satisfy all of the existing code baseline capabilities.

* There will be no additional cost to the Government if the scratch option is selected. The entire cost and risk is the contractor’s to bear to improve their ability to deliver a superior quality product. 

### General Operating and Development Objectives
* Successful vendor will possess and demonstrate proven expertise, including, but not limited to: 
- Project management support, including but not limited to:
    - Attending meetings (in-person and remote as appropriate)
    - Providing activity status update
    - Generating post mortems on each delivery item

* Inputs into the overall CCPO program management information needs

* Identify any resource challenges that impact delivery timeliness, performance, quality, or security considerations

* Providing status updates on typical management topics, including but not limited to:
    - Schedule
    - Budget
    - Risk
    - Delivery (Page 3, HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment J-1 6 July 2020)
    - Resources

* Software project/program management of delivery and sustainment of all development deliverables for the entire lifecycle of the project, including post development maintenance (typically referred to as Tier-3 support), operations, and sustainment. 

* Management and integration of end-to-end User Experience (UX) design throughout the CI/CD pipeline. Use of tools, technology, and software (stack) that avoids company lock-in for the delivery items, as well as minimizing or eliminating hosting environment lock-in to the vendor cloud environment.

* Delivery items demonstrating the use of open source software and platforms, cloud- based design and development, and commodity sourced solution components as a primary consideration.

* Demonstration of corporate culture use of modern software development and management practices.

* Expertise with formalized CI/CD Pipeline patterns (or equivalent approaches).

* Demonstrate the corporate approach to maintaining currency with evolving industry advancements or adoption of an improved equivalent lifecycle management framework.

* The CI/CD pipeline will implement the following, at a minimum:
    - A shared code repository.
    - A proven process to manage all code changes, approvals and baselines.
    - Automated software build tools for compiling of code and dependencies into software artifacts while maintaining version control.
    - Automated functional testing tools for unit and integration testing.
    - Automated security testing tools.
    - Container registries for version control.
    - An automated deployment process to manage ops (deployment operations) configurations and delivery.
    - An ability to manage at least three parallel and continuous CI/CD (or equivalent) streams including, but not limited to:
        ■ Requirements elicitation (e.g. storytelling, storyboarding, use case creation).
        ■ Rapid DevSec continuous interaction cycles including all necessary testing.
        ■ Optimized deployment (ops) with continuous process system injections/integration into the production environment.
        ■ Continuous user feedback processes to influence DevSec content and ops behaviors and outcomes.

* Research and validation should inform an iterative development cycle, continuously incorporating user feedback (Page 4, HQ0034-20-C-0245 Attachment J-1 6 July 2020) The pipeline will provide CI/CD of software deliveries. The tools in the pipeline include the following automation, as necessary:
    - A code repository to provide configuration management of code changes, approvals and baselines
    - Software build tools to support compiling of code and dependencies into software artifacts while maintaining version control
    - Functional testing tools for unit and integration testing
    - Security testing tools
    - Container registries for version control management 

### System Objectives: 
* Documentation -  The system shall be fully documented. All processes and procedures that are used to create, develop (to include system design and UIX design), configure, install, test, administer, deploy, operate, sustain, and repair shall be, at a minimum, delivered with any system release to the Government or in the approved CSP operating domain. 

* Reporting - The system shall be capable of reporting information that is identified during requirements elicitation, UIX design and system design.
